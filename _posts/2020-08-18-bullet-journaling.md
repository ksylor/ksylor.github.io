title: Bullet journals for the non-artistic
---

For the last few years, I've tried a whole bunch of different methods to try and organize my neverending to-do list with no luck, I never felt like I was making any progress. I tried just about everything digitial my app download history is littered with whatever the hottest app was - evernote, clear, todoist, notion, but every time I would try to change up my process and move to something digital, I failed, because I was fighting against decades of writing everything down. Something I've continued to do is to write things down! I generally take notes in most meetings by hand, I have always had to do lists written down, and the friction of transferring things to something digital just never clicked for me. I also tried various kinds of pre-formatted planners, meeting notes notebooks with separate to-do list notebooks, I have stacks and stacks of notebooks full of my illegible handwriting. 

So, about a month ago at this point, I re-discovered the bullet journal. Now, if you are like me, then you've got a misconception about the bullet journal method. You've googled it and the results are overflowing with "BuJo" - gorgeously designed instagrammable spreads with perfect penmanship, fancy notebooks adorned with washi tape, habit trackers, study guides, inspirational quotes, shopping lists, "how to acheive your goals!" etc. when all you want to do is learn a system to help wrangle the chaos in your life & work. Well, you don't have to do those things! Ryder Carrol's original system is simple. to be successful, I focused on that, but it was surprisingly hard to find real-world stories from folks who use the bullet journal, particularly to help wrangle their job as a software engineer. So, hopefully this is the post that I was looking for for someone else. And you don't need fancy supplies or artistic talent, I promise! 

The beauty of the bullet journal system is that it's completely flexible, but not totally structureless. You start with a blank page and then add your own dates or lines or whatever to it, there is no guilt that you missed a page or that you didn't fill out the calendar for that day or that the kinds of notes you want to take don't fit into the structure of the page in front of you. But, there's _just enough_ structure to it that you don't feel like you are endlessly circling without moving forward in tackling your to-do list. And, the best part is that you can start on any day you like, no worries about buying a planner for the year and leaving multiple days or months blank (the very thought of that gives me anxiety!).

Also, I decided to combine all of my life into a single book. Some folks might have separate places for work and life, but I really needed one notebook to rule them all

GTD 

# Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to just grab a notebook and do it! You don't need artistic talent and you don't have to be perfect - you can cross things out, cut out pages that don't work, try something new, throw away the things that don't work, and add new things that work for you. The beauty of the system is in it's flexibility. As you will see, my usage changed over time for the first month, and it will continue to change - particularly as I've been reading & learning more about the GTD process and started to layer pieces of that system onto my "classic" bullet journal.

I also highly recommend that you visit https://bulletjournal.com/ and browse around to watch the videos and tutorials there to get more in-depth on each piece of the system (especially https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn). I'll go over everything below, but with more of a focus on how I use them.

## Set up your notebook
I sat down in front of the TV one evening with a notebook and pen while I cross-referenced bulletjournal.com and other getting started blog posts on my phone. It took about an hour (most of which was spent filling in birthdays & holidays on the future log), but you can do it in a shorter time if you want to get going quickly.

1. **Grab a notebook and a writing implement** 
Any blank notebook will do! It's helpful if your notebook is small enough to be carried around easily - A5 (approx 5" x 8.5") is a good balance of carryability and space to write. Dotted or grid pages are helpful for drawing straight lines, and pre-numbered pages will cut out one of the setup steps, but neither are a requirement. Same with bookmarks, if it has 1 or more built-in ribbon bookmarks, great! If not, you can improvise.

I dove into my treasure trove of conference swag and chose an A5 sized notebook from Smashing Conference that has pre-numbered, dotted pages, and a single bookmark. As you can see from the photos, I made a few simple modifications over the course of the month - I superglued a second ribbon inside the back cover, and I used some elastic leftover from a tutu-making project to sew a pen holder loop & superglued that in too. 

For writing implements, any pen or pencil is great! I started out with a blue pen, misplaced that, and switched to black. I have been adding in some highlighters to help with visual "pop" and easier scannability, but they definitely are not required. 

2. **Number the pages of your notebook**
I lucked out and had a pre-numbered notebook, if you aren't so lucky do not stop and search for notebooks to buy thinking that you will come back to it, just number each page yourself.

3. **Add a Key of symbols to the first page or inside cover as a reference**
This is a suggestion I found online as an extension of the core system and I think it's super helpful for a beginner. As you can see from all the scribbles and crossing out, the symbols I've used have changed over time. At base, I use the classic "Rapid Logging" symbols from the original system, and I've added (and subtracted) a few of my own. feel free to use them or create your own based on your needs.

Rapid logging symbols:
(dot) = task
(dash) = note
(circle) = event
(x) = completed task
(gt) = migrated
(lt) = scheduled
(strikethrough) = irrelevant
(caret down) = delegated

Signifiers:
(clock) = due date
(asterik) = important
(question) = needs decision
(lighbulb) = idea

I also used this page to note the number of rows and columns in the grid to help me layout pages evenly. 

3. **Add an Index page**
The Index is really the key to the whole system - it's how you find the pages that you want to refer back to, and the beauty is that you can add anything you want to the Index, so nothing gets lost. Add the title "Index" to the top of the page, and leave this blank for now, we'll come back and fill it in in the next steps. Skip a page or two to leave space for your index to grow, and then move to the next step.

4. **Add a Future Log for the next 12 months**
The Future Log is a simple calendar view of the next year. Start with *next* month (I didn't realize this when I filled out mine and added the current month but didn't really need it). Because I am a perfectionist, I counted the number of horizontal rows per page and divided that by three to have three months per page, which took up a total of 4 pages. Flip back to your Index and add an entry for your Future Log (e.g. "Future log: 5-8").

The future log is the place to note events and commitments that are happening/need to happen in a specific month. I have my digital calendar where I keep track of my detailed day-to-day schedule of work meetings and personal appointments, so I don't use the future log for *everything*, mostly just the most important stuff with a date component: deadlines, a reminder to follow up with someone next month, upcoming conference talks, vacations, etc. I've been layering on pieces of the GTD system to my bullet journal practice, and I really like the approach of only putting things in the month that I absolutely have to commit to. I also added in holidays and birthdays, which in some months takes up a lot of space, so I might try a different layout for my next journal's future log. Tracking down birthdays and holidays also took me the longest during my setup time, so you can skip that and/or come back to it.

5. **Add a Monthly Log for this month**
Remember how we skipped this month in the future log? Well, that's because we are going to add in a whole-page calendar for this current month with a ton more detail as it's own page. If it's the middle or end of the month, that's okay! I filled out the entire month and then backfilled some important events from the previous weeks. I also used the OG system layout for this page, with one row per day annotated by the day of the week and date. Then, in the empty space below I added the most important tasks to finish for the month, but TBH I have tried this in two months now and it's not working for me, I lose track of these tasks because I'm focused on the calendar above above, so next month I will likely leave that off. Add this month as an entry in your index!

6. **Add a Monthly Tasks page for this month**
I originally had two pages, one for work and one for home, but that was almost too much room, I ended up adding a lot of ideas and tasks that I didn't get to which was a bit disheartening when it was time to write out the task list for the next month. So, the second month, I slimmed this down to a single page split it in half between work and home. As part of adding more GTD thinking to my approach, I'm trying to only add things to this list if they are a priority or if I absolutely _need_ to get these things done this month. Add this page to your Index and learn from my trial & error - indent everything under the current month's entry so you can more quickly scan things by month.

7. (optional) **Start a Brain Dump page** (This isn't "classic" bullet journal but something I added, so you can totally skip this step)
When I first started my Journal I had also just started reading GTD, so I decided to start the practice of getting everything out of my head and onto the page so that I could "close the open loops" in my brain. To that end, I filled out this page with all of the random things that were swirling around in my head in an unfiltered stream of conciousness. This was really helpful for filling out that initial Monthly Task list, and I'm working on figuring out a system for classifying and storing brain dump items according to GTD methodology. And of course, add this to your index! 

8. **Start your Daily Log**
This is really the core of the whole system and is where you will use those symbols from the key the most. Start each day by writing a date header for today - I usually do it in the format of `AUG 18 - TUES`. I tried some different ways to visually highlight the day header, but I've landed on drawing a simple horizontal line with a little strip of pink highlighter, which is about as fancy as I get. Then, start adding in some notes for today - add bullets for things that you've already done and cross them out! Don't pre-generate your next Daily Logs for future days, wait until you've completed the day before you draw a line & start the next day (more on this in process below).

# My Process
Now that your notebook is all set up, let's talk about the process of using this thing you've just created. This was one of the harder things to learn about beforehand, which was super frustrating. I wanted to know the exact details of when and how other people used this system in real life and work!

Really, what I've learned is that the foundation of the Bullet Journal system is to write everything down. I mean EVERYTHING. By far the biggest improvement it's made to my productivity is that it's one notebook to rule them all, no more multiple notebooks and pads and sticky notes scattered around my house and office. Put everything in one place so you can start to trust your journal as your external brain - something that the author of GTD calls "closing the open loops". If you have endless tasks and projects swirling around your brain, then you are expending valuable mental energy keeping those loops open. Writing things down in a system that you trust allows you to "close the loop" and use your brainpower for getting things done instead of endless worrying.

1. **Daily Logging**
At first, getting the hang of the Daily Log was the biggest challenge for me and I definitely went through some fits and starts while I figured out how to effectively use it. The system I've landed on to organize my Daily Logs is that I list out my important to-dos and appointments for the day at the beginning of that day's section using ALL CAPS so that each fits on one line and stands out a bit. Then, I will switch to note-taking mode, where I'm not exactly "rapid logging" everything, but combining bullets and longer-form notes in a looser style. Usually I will nest notes for a meeting or topic under a less visually strong header than the daily divider, and just take notes as I always have. In cases where I've captured enough important notes that I want to be able to refer back to that meeting, I just add the header & page number as a new "collection" entry in my index.  

2. **Adding Collections**
Collections are another part of bullet journaling that can feel intimidating, especially if you spend too much time on instagram & pinterest! I've found it helpful to think of a Collection as just a page full of stuff that you want to reference back to using the Index. So, it can be something specific like a brain dump, or a project plan, or a list of books you want to read, or something organic like notes from a meeting that you want to save. The notes that formed the basis of this blog post were a collection!

3. **Daily Migration**
Migration is just a fancy word for evaluating your prior day and getting ready for the next day. Either first thing in the morning, or in the evening as I'm winding down my work day, I go back and look through my log from the prior day and cross off any bullets that I completed, then move anything that I didn't complete (and still think is a priority) to the following day. Technically, you are supposed annotate tasks with a migrated arrow to show that you moved it to the next day, but I'm not always great at that. If something has a deadline or follow-up in the future, I move it into my Future Log. If there is something that I didn't complete and think that I should de-priorize, I will move it into either my Monthly Task list or my Future Log. 

I'll also take a look at my Monthly Log and my digital calendar to see if there are any upcoming deadlines or important meetings that I need to start working on or preparing for. Finally, I scan the monthly task list to cross off any tasks I completed that I had originally noted there, or if there are any other tasks to pull into my day. 

4. **Weekends**
As I go through the work week, my daily tasks tend to be a mix of 90/10 work/home (I put everything non-work into the "home" bucket). As mentioned above, I split out my Monthly Task list by context as a way to keep things organized. Throughout the week, as home tasks come up I move them to my Monthly Tasks list same as work-related to-dos. On weekends, my focus changes 100% to non-work tasks, so on Friday night or Saturday morning, I will write out a combined Daily Log for Sat/Sun, and pull a list of tasks, then mark them off and migrate them the same as during the work week. I've found with the Bullet Journal that I feel like my life is more under control because everything is in one place (One notebook to rule them all), so I try my best to continue to carry my journal everywhere and write everything down, even on the weekends.

5. **Monthly Migration & Setup**
At the end of the month, I set aside some extra time to setup a new Monthly Log and Monthly Task list for the following month, then I follow a process very similar to the Daily Migration, but at the level of the whole month. First, I move all of the entries from the Future Log for this month, and enter them into my new Monthly Log. I also check my digital calendar for any important meetings, events or appointments and add them to the Monthly Log. Then, I will go through and reevaluate my Monthly Task list to migrate those forward or move to the Future Log for another month.

6. **Navigating with Bookmarks**
I started out with one bookmark that I used to mark my current page. That worked great for the first month, but when I got to the second month and the monthly log was harder to find, I added a second bookmark so that I could just leave one on the Monthly Log for the current month, and use the other to mark my current page. So, I'd recommend if you have 0-1 built-in bookmarks that you superglue some ribbons to the cover/spine or use sticky note(s) to mark both pages.  

# What I'm still figuring out

While I absolutely love my Bullet Journal so far, I've found that one of the missing pieces in the "classic" system is a clear way to manage longer-term projects and ideas for the future (I have far too many ideas that don't see it to fruition!). This kind of capture, categorization, and execution is precisely what GTD focuses on, so I hope to continue layering on pieces of that system and incrementally improving my system for managing things that aren't discrete tasks. Some things I've tried that have been successful are:

- Writing out a targeted Brain Dump of web performance work-related ideas and projects, then transferring them to a digital document with more detailed notes, categorization by type of change, and a rough t-shirt sizing. As we spin up a new web performance team, my hope is that this list will form the basis for that team's roadmap (and close A TON of open loops in my brain!).

- Taking projects from my Brain Dump list and categorizing them in a Project Categorization List. I divided a page into sections for Home, Career, and Work, then migrated items into the appropriate category. Then, I annotated each one according to it's status - In progress, Next up, Someday/Maybe and Delegate it. Next, I'm planning to take each of these projects and add a page to the end of my Journal for each one that is in progress/next up, then use the guidance of the GTD system to list out discrete "Next Actions" that will move these projects forward.
