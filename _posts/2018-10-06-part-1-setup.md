title: Part 1 - Setup
---

Welcome! I'm blogging about my learning process to create a Live Git Viewer app using React, Node, ES6, etc. You can read more about the project and the impetus behind it in [Getting (re)Started](https://ksylor.github.io/2018/10/06/getting-restarted.html).

# The Plan
So, my general idea is to do as follows:

- Use Node to read the current state of a local repo.
- Use React to display a visualization of the current state.
- Watch for changes to the local repo.
- Update the visualization with some snazzy animations.

There's a whole lot of little questions embedded in these abstract steps. What kind of data structure should I use to represent the repo state? How will it work to publish changes from the repo to a react app? How do you handle state change animations in React? 

But, I think the biggest question I had was:

## How on earth am I going to read from a local git repo programmatically?

Initially I had some vague ideas about reading the files in the `.git` directory from disk, but this has to be a problem that other people have solved. So time for some googling! Thankfully my initial search for "accessing git repos programmatically" turned up [libgit2](https://libgit2.org/) and [nodegit](https://www.nodegit.org/) (node bindings for libgit2, which is written in C). LibGit2 provides a programmatic interface for interacting with a git repo and it's internal data structures. Sweet, this seems like just the thing I need, that was easier than I thought.

<aside>At this point I got minorly sidetracked into [reading more about git internals](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain), but I'll come back to that.</aside>

## Now it's time to make a React app! 

I've used create-react-app in the past, and it seems to still be the standard, so let's do that! I follow the instructions in the [create-react-app docs](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#creating-an-app) and after a few minutes of installing, I have a webpage visible at localhost:3000. 

That was super easy.

## Cool, I have a react frontend, now I need a Node backend - how do you do that? 

Hmm so there's a link to [integrating with an api backend](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#integrating-with-an-api-backend) from the main create react app docs, that seems promising.

The docs point to this tutorial on [Using create react app with a server](https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/using-create-react-app-with-a-server). It's a great explanation, especially the section called "The Rub", which goes into the issues inherent in making cross-app api calls. Buuuuut the steps are set up so you download from their repo and I've already got a different setup, so let's google some more to make sure I do this right.

Nice, [this article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-make-create-react-app-work-with-a-node-backend-api-7c5c48acb1b0) is a bit more stepwise & straightforward and starts with installing via create-react-app, so I can pick up from where I am already. 

<aside>I spend a little time learning more about [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon).</aside>

## Success!
After following the instructions above, I go to localhost:3000 once again and BOOM we have a React app communicating via an API to a Node backend!

## Back to git
Okay, let's turn off all these servers, install nodegit as a dependency of the main project and play around with that. The docs seem to be slightly better for the C version so I'm invisioning a lot of translation back and forth between languages. I figure out how to open my local repo and thanks to some help from this [Nodegit tutorial](https://radek.io/2015/10/27/nodegit/) I have code which will walk backwards from the HEAD commit in a repo and output the hash for each one.

```
repo: /Users/ksylormiller/ohshitgit/.git/
head: f6e51fdd6650c7bbc39895c0392ec6a9fb5a9c15
f6e51fdd6650c7bbc39895c0392ec6a9fb5a9c15

297c614835e577d24efb45c3c01a97f911ea5a42
```

Not half bad for two and a half hours' work. You can see the results at the [Git Live View repo](https://github.com/ksylor/git-live-view). Next up: I will need to figure out how to read the state of the workspace, index, and tracking branches.
